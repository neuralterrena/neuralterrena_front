## 2026-08-26 - O(N) Array Reduction in requestAnimationFrame is a Bottleneck
**Learning:** `WindParticles.tsx` calculates the closest latitude and longitude index on a grid (often 721x1440 resolution) for every particle (e.g. 360) on *every single frame*. The old approach used `reduce`, creating an `O(N)` scan per coordinate, leading to massive frame drops and severe battery consumption on mobile devices.
**Action:** Replace `O(N)` scans within `requestAnimationFrame` loops with `O(log N)` binary search or precomputed spatial indices.
## 2026-08-27 - Canvas state reset in requestAnimationFrame
**Learning:** Reassigning a `<canvas>` element's `width` or `height` clears its drawing buffer and resets its 2D context state. In `WindParticles.tsx`, unconditionally updating `canvas.width` and `canvas.height` on every frame inside `requestAnimationFrame` caused an expensive re-allocation and state reset, severely impacting performance.
**Action:** Conditionally update `canvas.width` and `canvas.height` (e.g. `if (canvas.width !== nextWidth)`) to avoid triggering unnecessary resets when dimensions haven't actually changed.
## 2023-10-25 - maplibre-gl transformRequest callback GC pressure
**Learning:** In Mapbox/MapLibre implementations, the `transformRequest` callback fires for every requested tile, glyph, and sprite. Doing expensive object instantiations like `new URL()` inside this callback causes severe garbage collection pressure and main-thread blocking, which can result in frame drops during map interactions.
**Action:** Pre-calculate variables (like origins or base URLs) outside the map instance or the `transformRequest` function when they don't change dynamically based on the URL being requested.
